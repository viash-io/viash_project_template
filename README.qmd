This repository is a template for setting up a new [Viash](https://viash.io) project.

## Setup
After forking this repository / using this template, you will need to clone the repository and run the following commands to install Viash and Nextflow in the `$HOME/bin/` directory.
Make sure this directory is on your `$PATH`.

```sh
# download viash in the $HOME/bin folder
curl -fsSL get.viash.io | bash -s -- --tools false --bin $HOME/bin

# also download nextflow in the $HOME/bin folder
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
mv nextflow $HOME/bin
```

## First development build

You can generate your first development build by running:

```{sh}
viash ns build --setup cachedbuild --parallel
```

The demo Nextflow pipeline uses these components to process
text files (in `resources_test/`) in a certain way.
You can run the following command to run the pipeline.

```sh
NXF_VER=22.10.4 nextflow \
  run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp
```
```{sh echo=FALSE}
NXF_VER=22.10.4 nextflow \
  run . \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp |
  sed 's#[^ ]*work#work#g'
```

## Customising the project

Generally, it's a good idea to edit the `_viash.yaml` by filling the details of your own repository here.

If you want to start from a clean repository, remove the contents of the `resources_test/`, `src/`, and `workflows/` directories.

## Unit testing

You can unit test all Viash components using the following command:


```{sh}
viash ns test --parallel
```

## Creating a release (manually)

The script below assumes you have a separate clone of this repository
specifically for building a release. To do so, switch to the release
branch, merge all changes from the main branch, build all components
and push the new release to Github and the containers to your Docker
registry of choice.

One time setup
```sh
# clone repo
git clone git@github.com:myusername/demo_pipeline.git demo_pipeline_release
cd demo_pipeline_release

# switch to release branch
git checkout release

# allow publishing the target folder
sed -i '/^target.*/d' .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "update gitignore for release"
```

For every build
```sh
TAG=0.2.0

# merge latest changes in the release branch
rm -r target
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# build target folder and docker containers
viash ns build --setup build --config_mod ".functionality.version := '$TAG'" --parallel

# run unit tests (ideally, these should all pass)
viash ns test --config_mod ".functionality.version := '$TAG'" --parallel

# push docker containers to container registry
viash ns build --config_mod ".functionality.version := '$TAG'" --setup push

# commit current code to release branch
git add target
git commit -m "Release $TAG"
git push

# create new tag
git tag -a "$TAG" -m "Release $TAG"
git push --tags
```

## Running a pipeline from release

When a release has been made, you can run the pipeline as follows:

```sh
NXF_VER=22.10.4 nextflow \
  run https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -r 0.2.0 \
  -resume -latest \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp
```
```{sh echo=FALSE}
NXF_VER=22.10.4 nextflow \
  run https://github.com/viash-io/viash_project_template \
  -main-script workflows/demo_pipeline/main.nf \
  -r 0.2.0 \
  -resume -latest \
  -with-docker \
  --input resources_test/file*.tsv \
  --publishDir temp |
  sed 's#[^ ]*work#work#g'
```

Since all the components and containers are published on Github, this
pipeline should be 100% reproducible.
